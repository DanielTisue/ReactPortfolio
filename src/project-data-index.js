  challenge:
    "Federico wanted a website that would more accurately represent him artistically and woulden't stray from original color coordination of his previous site. He also wanted clients to be able to contact him directly through his website. His ultimate focus was to have a more modern looking site with slightly different functionality.",
  process: "Initial site UI was done in Abobe XD to reform page layout, page architecture, and design form layout, . Photoshop/ Illustrator were used to design a logo and icons specific to OlivieriPhoto. Node mailer and a contact form was added to the the backend for site messaging capability.",
  solution: "Federico's site was condensed from four to two pages which allowed the user to have easier navigation. The landing page served most immediate information for quick searchers and minimized clicking effort. Few photos were showcased immediately on the landing page with option to explore his gallery further. Since the re-design Federico has been offered to exhibit his work at a local art gallery in Toronto and has given him more exposure.",

  challenge: "Design and build a website that allowed Markos to sell products but also create an online skate community. The site would contain ecommerce functionality, skaters to upload favorite skate spots and comment, and give Markos the ability showcase videos of their favorite local skaters. The techincal aspects would have to further include geolocation, pay option API, Cloudinary API (for both skate spot images & videos).  ",
  process:
    "Sketches were made to lay the skeletal groundwork for the site then built upon in Abobe XD: this mapped out the GUI of the website and its navigational architecture. Using React, the eccomerce portion of the page was created and the general landing page. The React ecommerce section existed as a front end application which could then be connected to the Skate spot search web application.",
